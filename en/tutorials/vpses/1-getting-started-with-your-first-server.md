# Getting started with your first VPS

## Introduction
So, you got your first VPS, but how can you use it? In this tutorial I'll guide you through the basic steps.

## Installing the VPS
First, you have to go into our panel and put an operating system on the VPS.
To do this, go to [cp.hexodo.net](http://cp.hexodo.net) and use the login details you got in the welcome email.

Next, click on the tab VPS. This is where all your VPSes are listed.  
Now you can select the VPS you want to set up.

After this, go to the Configuration tab. Here you can set several things. The option we're looking for is reinstallation. Click on the button and then select the OS you want to install.

If you're just new to servers, I would recommend selecting the latest Debian x86_x64.
